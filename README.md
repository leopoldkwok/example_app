# example_app

1. JavaScript questions are in the file Javascript_Test
2. Address book app

   - git clone https://github.com/leopoldkwok/example_app
   - cd example_app
   - type elasticsearch to load elastic search.
   - open another session and cd into example_app and run the rails server by typing rails s

The solution was created using Ruby on Rails. I enjoyed the exercise and it was a good learning experience to see what goes into making a filter that searches. 

Things to improve if I had more time:

1. Styling
2. Enabled the contacts to be saved on one single page
3. Enable an autocomplete feature as how Google does it.
